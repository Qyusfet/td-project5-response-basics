### **Screenshot**

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Desktop View</td>
        <td>iPad View</td>
        <td>MiniPad View</td>
        <td>Mobile View</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img scr="assets/screenshot/desktopview-1024px-plus.jpg" alt="desktop view" width=202 height=480></td>
        <td><img scr="assets/screenshot/iPadView-768px-plus.jpg" alt="iPad view" width=202 height=480></td>
        <td><img scr="assets/screenshot/MiniPad View-501px-767px.jpg.jpg" alt="Minipad view" width=202 height=480></td>
        <td><img scr="assets/screenshot/MobileView-500px-and-Below.jpg" alt="Mobile view" width=202 height=480></td>
    </tr>



## My process

    * The webpage is written with HTML named index.html and and designed with CSS named style.css
    * All the Images used in this project and css is placed in assets folder 
    * The HTML page is segegrated in 5 groups with DIV tag
    * The Five groups are named with class(Header, Profile, Project, Main-Contact and Footer)
    * Each groups are style with CSS with their class name and subtag in each class
    * All the social media icon in the footer page are linked to my official social media page.

### Built with

    - Semantic HTML5 markup
    - CSS custom properties
    - Flex
    - CSS Grid
    - Media Query


### What I learned

    *I am able to understand the use of grid system to arranged images used in this project to fit different viewport
    *I learned how to insert icon with unicode element to my html design
    *I now understand how to call up nth-child of a tag element


```css
    .project-sample{
        display: grid;
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
        grid-template-rows: 350px 350px;
    }
```
